Given a Javascript snippet and a library of code, recursively inline every function until the original snippet contains the same functionality but without calling any functions available in the library

Features:
	Function expanding, with argument replacing
	Forloop unrolling
	Subscript function calls get converted to switch statements [ object[selector]() ]

Limitations:
	Does not handle closures
	Can not handle multiple returns
	Recursive functions will continually expand
	Incorrect results when passing an incrementing variable through a call [ blahfunction(a++) ]
